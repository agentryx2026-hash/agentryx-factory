# Agentryx Dev Factory — Task Status Snapshot

**Last updated**: 2026-04-23
**Snapshot purpose**: single-page view of every phase's status. Read this first to know exactly what's built, where we are, and what's next. Per-phase detail lives in each `Phase_NN_*/` folder — this doc indexes them.

**How to keep this fresh**: update this file at every phase close (alongside the per-phase `Status.md` and `Lessons.md`). The "Last updated" date and the per-phase status row are the two things that must move. Don't let them drift.

## Headline numbers (as of 2026-04-23)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total phase entries (incl. 1.5, 2.5, 2.75) | 24 |
| Fully closed (foundation band) | **11** (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 4) |
| A-tier scaffolding shipped | **16** — 100% coverage (5-A through 20-A) ✅ |
| Sketch only (not started) | **0** (roadmap complete) |
| B-tier deferred (production wiring) | 17 subphases pending across phases 5-20 |
| Smoke-test assertions passing | **947** across 16 scaffolded modules |
| LLM spend across all scaffolding | **$0.00** |
| Phase tags on origin (rollback anchors) | 24 |

**Net release-band position**: v0.0.1 **A-tier complete**. All 20 phase slots have substrate; all scaffolding shipped behind feature flags defaulted off — production behavior is unchanged from Phase 4 close. Next band (R1) arrives by resolving the 17 deferred B-subphases, not by scaffolding new modules.

## Status legend

- ✅ **Closed** — done, merged, tagged, no further work planned in v0.0.1
- 🟡 **Partial (A-tier shipped)** — scaffolding library shipped, B-tier wiring deferred (real LLM, real UI, real integration)
- 📝 **Sketched** — one-line plan only; no code yet
- ⏳ **Deferred** — explicitly waiting on a known blocker (OpenRouter credit, user creds, scale, prior B-tier)

## B-tier deferral cohorts

The 11 deferred B-subphases group into 3 clear blockers. Once a blocker clears, the cohort can ship together.

### Cohort 1 — needs OpenRouter credit / TTS credentials (7 phases)
Each requires running real LLM or TTS pipelines end-to-end to validate.

- **5-B** MCP graph integration (rewire 5 graph files under `USE_MCP_TOOLS`)
- **6-B** Artifact-store dual-write (graph nodes write artifacts after every LLM call)
- **7-E** Memory-layer graph integration (post-LLM observation writes)
- **8-B** Parallel `dev_graph.js` (replace sequential edges with fan-out/join)
- **15-B** LLM proposer + real outcome comparators (depends on 6-B for artifact-level cost/latency signals)
- **16-B** LLM generators for training outputs (voiceover/storyboard prose quality; written guides); depends on 14-B for post-dev handler registration
- **17-B** Real ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS + Puppeteer/Playwright + ffmpeg for training videos (needs ElevenLabs/OpenAI credentials + ffmpeg binary on VM; depends on 14-B for handler)

**Cost estimate to clear all 7**: ~$15–40 in LLM + TTS spend on validation runs (or ~$50–100 if using Opus + ElevenLabs Pro tier).

### Cohort 4 — v1.0 release ops (1 phase, new)
- **20-B** Stripe billing + systemd/k8s health probes + cron retention + nightly backup + security review + load tests + v1.0 release ceremony (needs Stripe + S3/R2 creds + external pen-test budget)

### Cohort 2 — needs user creds + UI work (6 phases)
Each requires ops setup and React UI development.

- **9-B** Verify integration (Verify multi-app mode + auth choice + webhook)
- **10-B** Courier (Slack bot OAuth, GitHub App install, SMTP, Hermes container deploy)
- **11-B** Cost dashboard (depends on 10-B for alert pipe; React + HTTP)
- **12-B** B7 admin UI (extends `admin-keys.mjs`, React Admin pages, Postgres migration)
- **13-B** Replay UI (LLM stub + HTTP + timeline view + side-by-side diff)
- **14-B** Concurrency UI (queue depth + worker pool + per-project quotas)

**Natural ordering**: 10-B unblocks 11-B; 12-B is pre-req for ops-friendly admin of all the others; 9-B / 13-B / 14-B can ship in any order after.

### Cohort 3 — scale-dependent (3 phases)
Won't matter until factory operates at higher volume.

- **7-B** SQLite FTS5 backend for memory (worth it at 100+ observations)
- **7-C** Postgres backend (cross-host factory or Phase 14 multi-project pressure)
- **7-D** Vector / embedding backend (semantic recall when keyword no longer enough)

## What's next

**🎉 100% A-tier coverage achieved.** All 20 phase slots have substrate. No more greenfield scaffolding — R1 cutover is a B-tier marathon.

The remaining work lives in 17 deferred B-subphases across 4 cohorts:

- **C1 — OpenRouter + TTS credentials (7 phases, ~\$15-40 LLM spend)**: 5-B, 6-B, 7-E, 8-B, 15-B, 16-B, 17-B
- **C2 — UI + user creds (8 phases)**: 9-B, 10-B, 11-B, 12-B, 13-B, 14-B, 18-B, 19-B
- **C3 — Scale-dependent (3 phases)**: 7-B, 7-C, 7-D memory backends (activate at 100+ observations / multi-host / semantic-search load)
- **C4 — v1.0 release ops (1 phase)**: 20-B (Stripe + health endpoints + cron + backup + security/load/release ceremony)

Best next moves, depending on available inputs:

- **OpenRouter top-up** → Cohort 1 unlocks. Enables the first real end-to-end factory run with real LLM calls, which is the gate for R1.
- **UI sprint** → Cohort 2 unlocks. Admin UI (12-B) is the highest-leverage because it's the surface for every other B-tier's config knobs.
- **Stripe + S3/R2 + pen-test** → Cohort 4 unlocks 20-B and starts v1.0 release-band work.

**Or pause and ship what's built.** All 16 modules are independently consumable as libraries today. Anyone can `import { createCustomerPortal } from "./customer-portal/portal.js"` and use the substrate. The factory pipeline itself is unchanged from Phase 4 close; scaffolds are feature-flagged off.

---

## Working conventions (codified during this session)

- **PR flow** for every change since 5-A. No direct push to `main`. Squash-merge via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. Branch + tag every phase close. (See `D.Roadmap/README.md` "Git workflow" section for the 7-step sequence.)
- **Pre-phase code survey** is mandatory before scoping any phase (Phase 4 Lesson #1). Catches `memory.js` already exists, `llm_calls` table already exists, etc. Saves rewrites.
- **Scaffolding pattern** (proven 16× across 5-A → 20-A, codified in `03_Scaffolding_Pattern.md`):
  - `types.js` → `store/service` → `backend(s)` → `smoke-test` → `README` → 4 phase docs
  - Library lives alongside existing code, never replaces it
  - Feature flag with default off — zero regression
  - All deps injected (handler registry, fixRouter, nodeStubs, etc.)
- **Smoke tests assert content, not just shape.** Catches silent-degradation bugs (round-robin → FIFO; substitution → placeholder).
- **JSONL append-only logs** for every audit-ish data: artifacts (`index.jsonl`), memory (`index.jsonl`), queue (`_jobs/{queue,in-flight,done}/`), admin audit (`_admin-audit.jsonl`). Same mental model.

  - Foundation: `cognitive-engine/{tools,memory,graph,*_graph}.js`, `llm-router/`, `factory-dashboard/`, `server/admin-keys.mjs`
  - Phase 5+: `cognitive-engine/{mcp,artifacts,memory-layer,parallel,verify-integration,cost-tracker,courier,admin-substrate,replay,concurrency,self-improvement,training-gen,training-videos,marketplace,customer-portal,release}/`

## Append rules for future updates

When closing a new phase or changing status:

1. Bump the **Last updated** date at the top.
2. Update the affected row in the per-phase table.
3. Update the headline numbers if counts change.
4. If a B-tier cohort blocker clears, reflect it in "What's next."
5. Don't add per-phase narrative here — that belongs in `Phase_NN_Status.md`. This doc is the index, not the encyclopedia.
