# Phase 2 — Decisions Log

## D12 — Unified protocol is OpenAI Chat Completions

**What**: Router speaks OpenAI's `/chat/completions` shape. Swaps base URL to switch backends.

**Why**: Both LiteLLM proxy and OpenRouter expose this protocol. So do `vllm`, `ollama`, many third parties. Using OpenAI-format as the IR means router code is ~200 lines instead of ~2000 provider-specific ones.

**Rejected**:
- Native provider SDKs per backend (too much code, every new provider = new implementation).
- GraphQL / gRPC (no broad support).

**Tradeoff**: Loses some provider-specific features (e.g. Anthropic's native prompt caching, extended thinking). Acceptable at v0.0.1; Phase 2F (compare mode) or later phases can add per-provider direct SDK paths when needed.

## D13 — Direct-to-provider backends as fallback of fallbacks

**What**: `backends.js` also implements `direct-anthropic` and `direct-gemini` that bypass LiteLLM/OpenRouter and talk to the provider API directly.

**Why**: If LiteLLM container is down OR OpenRouter has an outage, we still want to hit a provider. Direct backends are the ultimate fallback.

**How to configure**: Add to the YAML fallback_chain — `[openrouter:claude-opus, openrouter:gpt-5, direct-anthropic:claude-opus]`. Router parses `backend:model` syntax.

## D14 — Keep LangChain, add adapter (not strip LangChain)

**What**: Phase 2B builds a `RouterChatModel` that implements LangChain's `BaseChatModel` interface; factory_graph.js just swaps `new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(...)` for `new RouterChatModel({task: 'architect'})`.

**Why**: LangGraph's state reducers, checkpointing, conditional edges are all useful — don't throw them away. Adapter is ~50 lines; full rewrite is ~500.

**Rejected**: Full rewrite in plain JS — tempting but loses observability primitives we'd have to rebuild.

## D15 — Build OpenRouter backend before LiteLLM container

**What**: Ship Phase 2A with OpenRouter backend working. Add LiteLLM container in later step of 2A (self-host = more moving parts).

**Why**: OpenRouter is hosted → zero ops. Gets us to "router works" faster. LiteLLM is the cheaper long-term answer (no markup) but that's a cost optimization for v1.0.

**Both remain** per configurability principle (admin flips `LLM_ROUTER_BACKEND` env).

## D16 — Provisional price table; admin UI edits in Phase 12

**What**: `configs/llm-prices.yaml` hand-maintained with best-effort values per $/MTok as of knowledge cutoff.

**Why**: Provider prices shift; keeping a live feed via provider APIs is Phase 11's problem. For now: a YAML file is good enough for approximate cost tracking. Phase 12 admin UI lets Super Admin edit.

**Caveat**: Knowledge cutoff 2026-01 + no WebSearch in this session = prices may be stale. Lessons file gets "check prices first thing after deploy" as a to-do.

## D17 — Cost capture is fail-open, not fail-closed

**What**: If the Postgres insert into `llm_calls` fails (DB down, transient error), the completion still returns successfully — we log to stderr and continue.

**Why**: An outage in observability should not take down production LLM calls. We accept occasional lost rows as the tradeoff.

**Exception**: Budget cap check. That IS synchronous — if we can't read past spend, we fail-closed (refuse the call) to avoid runaway cost. Admin can override with an env var `LLM_ROUTER_ALLOW_UNCHECKED=true` (off by default).

## Decisions made during Phase 2A execution

### D17.1 — Cap `max_tokens` at 4096 in OpenAI-compatible backends

**What**: All `/chat/completions` POSTs include `max_tokens: 4096` even if caller doesn't specify.

**Why**: Discovered during 2A smoke test — OpenRouter pre-reserves credit at the model's default ceiling (64K for Claude Haiku). Tiny replies were failing with `402 insufficient credits` on accounts with $1+ balance. 4096 is sane for most factory tasks. Per-task overrides land in 2D.

**Future**: Add `max_tokens` to per-task config so e.g. `architect` can use 16K and `cheap` stays at 2K.

### D17.2 — Fall-over semantics: only payload-shape 4xx breaks the chain

**What**: Original retry logic broke the chain on any 4xx (treating it as "non-retryable"). Now only `413/414/415/422` (payload too large, URI too long, unsupported media, unprocessable entity) break the chain. Everything else — `401/402/403/429/5xx` — falls over to the next entry.

**Why**: 401 (auth) and 402 (billing) are per-backend. A 401 from `direct-anthropic` doesn't predict failure on `openrouter:anthropic/...`. The next entry might use a totally different key + provider. So fall over.

**Caught by**: 2A smoke test — first chain run failed with 401 from openrouter (no key set yet) but the chain stopped instead of trying `direct-anthropic` which had a valid key. Fixed in commit `dc6546b`.

## Phase 2B Decisions

### D18 — Duck-type LangChain interface, don't extend `BaseChatModel`

**What**: `RouterChatModel` implements `.invoke()`, `.call()`, `._llmType()`, `.withTask()`, `.withContext()` but does NOT extend any LangChain class.

**Why**:
1. Zero-dep on LangChain — adapter ships with the router package, no peer-dependency war.
2. `BaseChatModel` is a moving target across LangChain versions. Duck typing pins us only to the surface we actually use.
3. Simpler — ~50 LOC instead of 200+ for full interface.

**Tradeoff**: Lose access to LangChain's `RunnableLambda` chaining and built-in tracing. Acceptable at v0.0.1; if needed, swap to subclassing later — won't break existing call sites.

### D19 — Symlink `llm-router` into `cognitive-engine/node_modules/@agentryx-factory/`

**What**: One-liner `ln -s` makes `import { RouterChatModel } from '@agentryx-factory/llm-router'` resolve cleanly from cognitive-engine, without setting up workspaces or publishing to a registry.

**Why**: cognitive-engine isn't yet inside the mono-repo (Phase 1.5 will fold it in). Symlink is the lowest-friction integration that keeps imports stable across the migration. The same import path works before and after Phase 1.5 — only the symlink target changes.

### D20 — `USE_ROUTER` as a third option, NOT a replacement

**What**: Each cognitive-engine graph now has 3 model paths controlled by env vars: `USE_ROUTER=true` (router), `USE_ANTIGRAVITY_BRIDGE=true` (filesystem bridge), default (direct Gemini). All three coexist.

**Why**: Configurability principle. We're at v0.0.1 R&D — we want to compare all three approaches on the same workload. Defaulting `USE_ROUTER=true` would silently switch the system over and lose the comparison.

### D21 — Dynamic import for the router so default path stays zero-risk

**What**: `let RouterChatModel; if (USE_ROUTER) ({ RouterChatModel } = await import('@agentryx-factory/llm-router'));` — only loads the package when the env var is set.

**Why**: If router has any bug at module-init time (bad import, missing dep), the default `USE_ROUTER=false` path is completely unaffected. Dev_graph.js loads identically to its pre-2B state when router is off.

## Phase 2C Decisions

### D22 — `pg` becomes the router's first runtime dependency

**What**: `llm-router/package.json` now depends on `pg ^8.13.0`. Brought 14 transitive deps.

**Why**: Couldn't avoid it — Postgres is the cost store. Considered:
- Native `node-postgres` via raw socket (would have to write protocol parser; absurd).
- Wrap an HTTP layer (PostgREST, etc.) — adds a service hop and operational burden.
- `pg` is the standard, battle-tested. 14 deps is acceptable.

**Future cleanup**: If we ever package router for distribution to environments without Postgres, gate `pg` behind a peer-dep + lazy import. Not needed for v0.0.1.

### D23 — 2-second timeout on the cost-capture INSERT

**What**: `Promise.race(insert, sleep(2000))` in `db.js` so a slow Postgres can't delay completions noticeably.

**Why**: Average INSERT to a healthy local Postgres is <5ms; if it takes >2s something is wrong (lock contention, network blip). At 2s, the user-visible LLM call latency would noticeably increase. Better to drop the row to stderr fallback and keep the agent responsive.

### D24 — `projectSpendSinceMidnight()` lives in `db.js`, not as Phase 2E code

**What**: The function that the budget-cap check (Phase 2E) will call already exists in `llm-router/src/db.js`.

**Why**: Keep all Postgres interactions inside the router package. Phase 2E only adds the call site, not the query. This makes the router a self-contained unit — downstream code (cognitive-engine, dashboard) never opens a Postgres connection just to ask about LLM cost.

### D25 — `llm_cost_by_project_day` view ships with the migration

**What**: View created in `001-llm-calls.sql` aggregates project × day → cost / calls / tokens / latency.

**Why**: The Phase 2G dashboard panel reads from this view, not from `llm_calls` directly. Adding the view in the same migration keeps schema cohesive — anyone who has the table also has the view. Dashboard doesn't need to know how the aggregation works.
